'''Calculates Synchrotron Emission from Thermal & Non-thermal Electrons

This module contains the functions needed for computing the synchrotron flux for a relativistic shock used in Ferguson and Margalit (2025; FM25). A combined distribution of thermal and non-thermal (power-law) electrons following the model presented in Margalit & Quataert (2024; MQ24) is considered. 
There are three main functions: F, which calculates the emergent synchrotron spectral flux from the full post-shock volume; L_thin_shell, which computes the spectral flux assuming the emitting electrons come only from an infinitesimal shell at the shock front; and L_MQ24, which 
adapts the function Lnu_of_nu() from MQ24 for use in the present context.
